# Creating-a-Pythagorean-triangle-from-numbers-1-to-100

This program determines the numbers from 1 to 100 that can form the pythagoras triangle.


In mathematics, the Pythagorean theorem, also known as Pythagoras' theorem, is a fundamental relation in Euclidean geometry among the three sides of a right triangle. It states that the area of the square whose side is the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the areas of the squares on the other two sides. This theorem can be written as an equation relating the lengths of the sides a, b and c, often called the "Pythagorean equation": 

a^{2}+b^{2}=c^{2},

If two triangles have two sides of the one equal to two sides of the other, each to each, and the angles included by those sides equal, then the triangles are congruent (side-angle-side). The area of a triangle is half the area of any parallelogram on the same base and having the same altitude.
